                <h2>"A man's actions are determined by necessity" best known for his theory of relativity and contributions to theoretical Physics, Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. His writings and research on quantum theory, wormholes and Thermodynamics continue to ignite curiosity in the minds of budding scientists even today. The world as I see it (1934) was written in the aftermath of world War I and Hitler?s rise to power; here, Einstein hopes for a peaceful world amid all the chaos of equations in his life. Far from the scientific jargon, in this series of letters, articles and interviews, Einstein reaches out to a larger audience as he gives an insight into his thoughts about education, ethics, politics, Science, religion, issues in the Jewish world and more.</h2 >
